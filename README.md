# Oncology Imaging Concept Detection

This project explores deep learning approaches for concept detection in oncology medical images.

The goal is to develop interpretable models that associate imaging features with clinically meaningful concepts, supporting research in medical computer vision and cancer analysis.

## Current focus

- Dataset exploration
- CNN baseline models
- Explainability methods (Grad-CAM)
- Multimodal extensions

## Background

This work extends prior MSc research on radiology concept detection using large-scale medical image datasets.


## Current milestone:
- Setting up reproducible PyTorch baseline using chest X-ray dataset (binary classification).
